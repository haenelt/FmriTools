def calculate_area(filename_surf, filename_area=""):
    """Calculate area.

    The function calculates vertex-wise surface area. The code is taken from the
    octave code surf2area.m from Anderson Winkler found in his github repository
    [1]. Consider a triangular face ABC
    with corner points
    a = [x_A, y_A, z_A]'
    b = [x_B, y_B, z_B]'
    c = [x_C, y_C, z_C]'
    The area for this triangle is given by the normed cross product
    A = |u x v|/2 with u = a - c and v = b - c. This is a face-wise surface area
    representation. To convert this to a vertex-wise representation, we assign
    each vertex one third of the sum of the areas of all faces that meet at that
    vertex, cf. [2].

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename_surf : str
        Input file geometry on which surface area is calculated.
    filename_area : str, optional
        File name of the surface area file. The default is "".

    Returns
    -------
    dpv : ndarray
        Vertex-wise surface area.
